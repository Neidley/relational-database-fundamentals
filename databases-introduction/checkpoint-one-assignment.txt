1. Given the values table below, what data types do each of these values represent?

  A Clockwork Orange - string
  42 - integer
  09/02/1945 - date
  98.7 - float

2. Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.

  A text file might be used when only one person at any time needs to have access to the data it holds.
  A database is needed when multiple people may need to read or update the data simultaneously.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

  SQL is declarative; you describe a result and the database decides how best to access and deliver the
  requested data.
  Other languages such as JavaScript and Ruby require the user to include methods instructing
  how to iterate over the data to retrieve the desired result(s).

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

  Databases allow varying data types to exist in two dimensions. For example, a database of a movie theater schedule
  would need to have columns such as "Movie Title" and "Showtimes" but that only helps if you also
  have rows to bind a movie to its correct showtimes.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

  In relational databases, and flat file databases, a table is a set of data elements (values)
  using a model of vertical columns (identifiable by name) and horizontal rows,
  the cell being the unit where a row and column intersect.
  A table has a specified number of columns, but can have any number of rows.
  Each row is identified by one or more values appearing in a particular column subset.
  A specific choice of columns which uniquely identify rows is called the primary key.

6. List 3 data types that can be used in a table.

  String
  Integer
  Float
