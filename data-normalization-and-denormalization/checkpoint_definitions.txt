CONCEPT	DESCRIPTION
Normalization

  process of designing or structuring data in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
  This involves organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) in relational databases

Denormalization

  process performed on a previously-normalized database to increase read performance.
  This happens at the expense of losing some write performance, by adding redundant
  copies of data or by grouping data.

Data integrity

  a key benefit of normalization. A lack of redundant, neglected data in normalization
  helps update anomalies (mistakes) and data inconsistencies

1NF

  first normal form: a column of a table cannot contain multiple values

2NF

  second normal form: the table must be in 1NF, and all non-key attributes cannot
  be dependent on a subset of the primary key

3NF

  the table must be in 2NF, and all transitive functional dependencies of non-prime
  attributes must not exist.

Boyce Codd normal form (BCNF)

  table must be in 3NF, as well as for every dependency X -> Y, X must be a super key of the table.

super key

  a set of attributes within a table whose values can be used to uniquely identify all other attributes
